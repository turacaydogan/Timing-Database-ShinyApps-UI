Stimulus: 
White circle (diameter 6.69 degrees) presented centrally against a grey background

Manipulations:
No between-subject manipulations. The proportional difference between Standard and Comparison was adjusted through a staircase procedure (3-up-one-down)

Feedback:
After each response, each subject received auditory feedback about whether their response was correct (high beep) or incorrect (low beep). 

Subject demographics:
Average age = 20.6
SD age = 1.88

Type of the response device used:
Keyboard

Experiment Setting:
Lab

Training:
4 practice trials were given before the experiment

Primary aim:
Study which model fits sequential effects in duration discrimination best

Main result:
Results were most consistent with a Kalman filter, which suggests that a dynamic prior is updated by each presented duration (so both Standard and Comparison), weighted by the relative precision of previous obsevations (prior) and current sensory observation (likelihood). 

Special instructions:
No explicit countermeasures were taken against chronometric counting

Data and time of data collection:
December 2018, between 9:00 and 16:00

Location of Data Collection:
the Netherlands, Groningen (instructions in English)

Other tasks:
No other tasks were performed

Variable coding:
Duration_set contains all possible durations of the Standard. Order means the order in which Standard and Comparison are presented within a trial: 'SC' for Standard first, 'CS' for Comparison first. For responses, 'S' means 'Comparison was Shorter than Standard', and 'L' means 'Comparison was Longer than Standard'

Exclusion:
We excluded one participant from analysis because the experiment was not finished. We further excluded one participant based on predefined performance criteria (difference between Standard and Comparision should not exceed 100% during the experiment).
