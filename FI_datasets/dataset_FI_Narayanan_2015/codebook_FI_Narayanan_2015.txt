Stimulus: Visual
Manipulations: Different drug types
Feedback: Rats' lever press to get water
Subject demographics: 6 male Long-Evans rats (aged 2 months; 200–225 g)
Type of response device used: lever
Experiment setting:  in the home cage. Single housing and a 12 h light/dark cycle were used; all experiments took place during the light cycle
Training: Rats were trained in interval timing tasks using standard operant procedures described in detail previously (Parker et al.,2014, 2015). First, animals learned to make operant lever presses to receive liquid rewards. After fixed-ratio training, animals were trained in a 12 s fixed-interval timing task in which rewards were delivered for responses after a 12 s interval
Main result of the study: the influence of D1-dopamine signals on frontal neuronal activity adheres to a U-shaped curve, and that cognition requires optimal levels of dopamine in frontal cortex
