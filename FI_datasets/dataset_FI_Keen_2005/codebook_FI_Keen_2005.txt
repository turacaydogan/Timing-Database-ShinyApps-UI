Subject demographics: Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats
Type of response device used: LEDphotocell (Model ENV-254)
Experiment setting: The 12 chambers (25 x 30 x 30 cm) were located inside ventilated, noise-attenuating boxes (74 x 38 x 60 cm). Each chamber was equipped with a food cup, a water bottle, and two levers.
Training: 
The primary aim of the experiment:The purpose of this study was to determine the behavioral effects of fenbendazole on rats tested by using various conditioning and timing procedures. 
Main result of the study: Results suggest that behavioral studies are unlikely to be influenced by fenbendazole treatment given before or during a study.
Special instructions: Fixed Interval Reinforced Distribution
Note:Conditioning_Type: the type of conditioning procedure that is utilized (food delivery before or after 10s or trace).
