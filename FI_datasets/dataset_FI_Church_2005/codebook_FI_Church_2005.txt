Stimulus: Visual and Auditory
Manipulations: Different types of Fixed Intervals
Feedback: Rats head entry into food pellet
Subject demographics: Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats
Type of response device used: LEDphotocell (Model ENV-254)
Experiment setting: The 12 chambers (25 x 30 x 30 cm) were located inside ventilated, noise-attenuating boxes (74 x 38 x 60 cm). Each chamber was equipped with a food cup, a water bottle, and two levers.
Training: 
The primary aim of the experiment:  A quantitative theory of timing or conditioning can be evaluated with a Turing test in which the behavioral results of an experiment can be compared with the predicted results from the theory. 
Main result of the study: A Turing test provides a graded metric for the evaluation of a quantitative theory.
Special instructions: Fixed Interval Reinforced Distribution
