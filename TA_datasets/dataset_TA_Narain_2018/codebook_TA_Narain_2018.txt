Stimulus: Visual
Manipulations: Varying inter-tap-intervals(ITI), pacing interval
Feedback: Key pressing
Subject demographics: Seven human participants (2 female, 5 male)
Type of response device used: Keyboard
Experiment setting: Participants viewed all stimuli binocularly from a distance of approximately 67 cm on either a 23-inch Apple A1082 LCD monitor at a resolution of 1900 × 1200 driven by an Intel Macintosh Mac Pro computer, or a 24-inch early 2009 Apple Mac Pro at a refresh rate of 60 Hz in a dark, quiet room
Training: 3 synchronisation taps
The primary aim of the experiment:Numerous behavioral studies have shown that humans rely on prior knowledge to mitigate the uncertainty in sensory measurements, as predicted by Bayesian theory
Main result of the study:  ITIs were biased toward the mean of the prior in both phases (Fig. 8f, g) and that the magnitude of the bias was larger in the continuation phase (paired t-test t5 = 4; p = 0.01).
