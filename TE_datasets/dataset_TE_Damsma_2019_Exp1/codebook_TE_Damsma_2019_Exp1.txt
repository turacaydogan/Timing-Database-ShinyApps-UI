Estimating Time: Comparing the Accuracy of Estimation Methods for Interval Timing. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pg7bsStimulus: VisualManipulations: Three different timing tasks: motor reproduction, timeline estimation, and verbal estimation. Target intervals also varied within each taskFeedback: In the form of a timeline, bars on the top marked the onset and offset of the objective target and bars below the line marked participant's estimations.Subject demographics: Healthy adults (mean age 22.65)Type of response device used: KeyboardExperiment setting: LabTraining: 12 practice trials beore starting to the timeline and the estimation method The primary aim of the experiment: To compare different interval timing tasks in terms of their accuracy, precision and efficiency.Main result of the study: More veridical verbal estimates than the motor and line estimates. Decreased CV as the duration increased. Precision was highest in verbal estimates when duration was a rounded integer. Precision in motor control was higher than line estimates.Special instructions: Instructions on timing task.Date of data collection: 2019Location of data collection: Not knownData formatted by: Serkan Salcan (serkansalcann@gmail.com)
