Seth, Warrick Roseboom; Perceptual Content, Not Physiological Signals, Determines Perceived Duration When Viewing Dynamic, Natural Scenes. Collabra: Psychology 1 January 2019; 5 (1): 55. doi: https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.234
Stimulus: Audiovisual
Manipulations: Different types of videos
Feedback: Reporting estimated duration of stimulus
Subject demographics: Fifty-five human participants (40 female, average age 21.4)
Type of response device used: keyboard
Experiment setting: LaCie Electron 22 BLUE II 22” with screen resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels and refresh rate of 60 Hz
Training: no training
The primary aim of the experiment: physiological influences on human duration estimates for naturalistic videos between 1–64 seconds using cardiac and eye recordings. Duration estimates were biased by the amount of change in scene content. 
Main result of the study:  Our results support a recent proposal that tracking change in perceptual classification networks provides a basis for human time perception, and suggest that previous assertions of the importance of physiological factors should be tempered.
