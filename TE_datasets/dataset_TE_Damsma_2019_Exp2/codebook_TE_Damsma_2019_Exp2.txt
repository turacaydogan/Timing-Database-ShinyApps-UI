Estimating Time: Comparing the Accuracy of Estimation Methods for Interval Timing. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pg7bsStimulus: Visual-a stream of numeric characters (1 to 9 characters in total) and onealphabetic target character.Manipulations: Two different timing tasks: motor reproduction and timeline estimation. Sixdifferent total stream durations (4.75, 5.25, 5.75, 6.25, 6.75, and 7.25 s).Feedback: In the form of a timeline, bars on the top marked the onset and offset of the stream and the target time in between and bars below the line marked participant's estimations.Subject demographics: Healthy adults (mean age 20.64 years)Type of response device used: KeyboardExperiment setting: LabTraining: 12 practice trials beore starting to the timeline and the estimation method The primary aim of the experiment: To compare different interval timing tasks in terms of their accuracy, precision and efficiency.Main result of the study: More veridical motor estimates than the line estimates fro stream estimates. Decreased CV as the interval to target onset increased but CVs were comparable for total stream duration estimates. Precision was highest in verbal estimates when duration was a rounded integer. Precision in motor control was higher than line estimates.Special instructions: Instructions on timing task.Date of data collection: 2019Location of data collection: Not knownData formatted by: Serkan Salcan (serkansalcann@gmail.com)
