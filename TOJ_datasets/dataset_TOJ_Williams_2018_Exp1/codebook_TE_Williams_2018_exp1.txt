Stimulus: Auditory, visual & tactile
Manipulations: Modality and duration of stimulus
Feedback: Reporting estimated duration of stimulus
Subject demographics: Fifty-two human participants 
Type of response device used: keyboard entry
Experiment setting:  A PC presented the experiments, written in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). A 17-in. flat-screen Samsung Syncmaster monitor stood at a distance of 60 cm from the chin rest.
Training: 5 trials of training
The primary aim of the experiment: to observe whether modality affect the temporal difference threshold
Main result of the study: participants found the task easiest for auditory intervals, followed closely by tactile intervals, whereas distinguishing between durations of visual intervals appears to have been more difficult.
Special instructions: Temporal order judgement
Date of data collection: 2018
Location of data collection: Unknown
