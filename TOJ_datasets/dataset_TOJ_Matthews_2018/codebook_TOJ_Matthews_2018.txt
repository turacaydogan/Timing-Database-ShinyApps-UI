Stimulus: Visual
Manipulations: Same visual stimulie presented to participants who have different types of roles in a band
Feedback: providing first object to change direction (left or right)
Subject demographics: One hundred thirty-two college-aged (18–22 years old) people of either sex participated. Participants included 25 percussionists, 71 brass players, and 36 color guard from the DCI Bluecoats, a highly competitive music and dance ensemble.
Type of response device used: Computer keyboard
Experiment setting: The experiment ran on HP EliteOne 800 desktop computers, each with a Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise operating system. Matlab 2017a software called functions from the Psychophysics toolbox
Training: To develop familiarity with the dynamic plaid stimuli, participants began the experiment passively viewing Movies 1–8, which contain relatively exaggerated (300 ms) asynchronies. 
The primary aim of the experiment:  investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments (TOJs) more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training
Main result of the study:  visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intramodally, even when intramodal training and testing stimuli closely match.
Special instructions: Temporal Order Judgement
