Stimulus: Auditory
Manipulations: Type of stimulus (filled or empty)
Feedback: Reporting estimated duration of stimulus
Subject demographics: thirty-two human participants 
Type of response device used: keyboard
Experiment setting:  A PC presented the experiments, written in E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA). A 17-in. flat-screen Samsung Syncmaster monitor stood at a distance of 60 cm from the chin rest.
Training: no training
The primary aim of the experiment: to observe whether filled or empty stimulus affect the temporal order judgement
Main result of the study:  participants found the task easier for filled than for empty durations, as indicated by a sharper decline in the difference in duration between the standard and the comparator, as well as by the lower within-participant standard errors. 
Special instructions: Temporal Order Judgement
